# TestSphere – End-to-End QA Testing Project

## 📌 Project Overview
TestSphere is a beginner-to-intermediate level **QA Engineer project** designed to demonstrate practical knowledge of:

- Manual Testing
- Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
- Test Design Techniques
- Basic Automation Testing using Java
- Database Testing using PostgreSQL
- CI/CD concepts using Jenkins
- Compatibility Testing across Operating Systems and Browsers

This project focuses on **real-world QA practices**, not just tools.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to simulate how a **QA Engineer works in an industry environment**, especially when:

- Applications must support **legacy operating systems**
- Compatibility issues exist across OS and browsers
- Manual testing forms the foundation before automation
- Testing is integrated into CI/CD pipelines

---

## 🧪 Application Under Test (AUT)
A simple **Task Management Web Application** with the following features:

- User Login & Logout
- Create, Update, Delete Tasks
- Task Status Management (Pending / In Progress / Completed)
- Search and Filter Tasks

---

## 🧠 Testing Approach

### 1. Manual Testing
Manual testing is performed first to:
- Understand application behavior
- Identify functional defects
- Design effective automation scripts later

Artifacts created:
- Test Plan
- Test Scenarios
- Test Cases
- Bug Reports
- Test Summary Report

---

### 2. Test Design Techniques Used
- Equivalence Partitioning
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- State Transition Testing
- Decision Table Testing

---

### 3. Automation Testing
Automation is used for:
- Regression testing
- Repeated execution of stable test cases

Implemented using:
- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG
- Page Object Model (OOPs concepts)

---

### 4. Database Testing
Database testing is performed using **PostgreSQL** to:
- Validate data integrity
- Verify CRUD operations
- Ensure UI actions reflect correctly in the database

---

### 5. Compatibility Testing (Key Focus)
This project includes compatibility testing across:

- Operating Systems: Windows XP (conceptual), Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 11
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge

Compatibility testing ensures:
- Backward compatibility
- Identification of OS-specific or browser-specific defects
- Real-world enterprise readiness

---

### 6. CI/CD Integration
Automation tests are integrated with **Jenkins** to:
- Run tests automatically after code changes
- Detect failures early
- Support continuous testing
